# Cluster-Randomization Experiment  

# Overview  
This repository contains all the code and base data which is needed to generate the evidence of the manuscript #TBD.  
===============

The code makes use of packages written specifically for the project:  
# Installation  
```{r, eval=F}
# install from CRAN: (Not implemented yet)
install.packages("jumble")
```
# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("kmcconeghy/jumble")
```
This package relies heavily on the suite of packages and programming termed "Tidyverse" that must be installed for proper functioning. In order to recreate the reports, a latex software must be installed (we favor `tinytex`).  

# Latest Version Updates  
This repository is in the early stages of development. Many changes may occur in a short amount of time.
